PrettyTime
==========

Version 0.0.5a

Had enough of dates and times in Python?  Sick of boilerplate like `datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=12)` when you're just trying to say "three months from now"?

Welcome to PrettyTime:

```python
t(3).months.from_.today
``` 

PrettyTime is a small Python package that intends to create a better interface for working with dates and times in Python.  It was inspired by Rails' syntax for dates and times, like:

```ruby
3.days.ago
2.hours.from_now
```

Though Python does not allow the same type of built-in monkey-patching, you can get decently close.  An example of what PrettyTime currently offers:

```python
>>> t(4).hours.from_.now
datetime.datetime(2014, 6, 7, 3, 51, 51, 422545)
>>> t(1).years.from_.today
datetime.date(2015, 6, 6)
>>> t()
datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 28, 16, 58, 1, 229448)
```

## Usage

### Download
Install from PyPI:

    pip install prettytime

Alternatively, you can clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jdotjdot/PrettyTime):

    git clone https://github.com/jdotjdot/PrettyTime

### Import

    from prettytime import t

### Use

Because you can't override Python literals, all integers must be wrapped by `t()`.  Everything else tries to be normal English.

Just using `t()` by itself with no arguments returns the time now, directly calling `datetime.datetime.now()`.  You can get today's date with `t().date()`

Commands currently supported:

Date/Time   | Relative |    Optional   |   Optional |
------------|----------|---------------|------------|
`second(s)` | `ago`    | `next`        | `week`     |
`minute(s)` | `from_`  | `last`        | `month`    |
`hour(s)`   | `before` |  `now`        | `year`     |
`day(s)`    | `after`  | `today`       |            |
`week(s)`   |          |  `tomorrow`   |            |
`month(s)`  |          |  `yesterday`  |            |
`year(s)`   |          |  `then`       |            |

To get the time difference from an arbitrary date, you can pass in a `date` or `datetime` object (including those generated by PrettyTime) into the `then()` method.

Examples:

```python
>>> from prettytime import *
>>> t(3).days.from_.next.year
datetime.date(2015, 6, 15)
>>> t(4).years.ago
datetime.date(2010, 6, 12)
>>> t(10).months.before.last.week
datetime.date(2013, 8, 5)
>>> t(7).minutes.after.tomorrow
datetime.datetime(2014, 6, 13, 23, 57, 44, 38401)
>>> t(2).days.from_.then(datetime.date(2015, 2, 3))
datetime.date(2015, 2, 5)
>>> t(3).days.from_.today == t(3).days.from_.then(t().date())
True
```

## Planned changes:

 + Add [`django-pretty-times`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-pretty-times/0.1.0)-like functionality to allow pretty printing as well

## Pretty Printing

You can call the `._print()` method on any PrettyTime object to get a pretty-printed string of the time. The method has an optional parameter `print_stdout` that defaults to `False`. If `print_stdout` is `True`, the method will print the string to the standard output. Otherwise, it will return the string. Here are some examples:

```python
>>> t(3).days._print()
"3 days"
>>> t(2).hours.from_.now._print()
"2 hours from now"
>>> t(1).week.ago._print()
"1 week ago"
>>> t(3).days._print(print_stdout=True)
3 days
>>> t(2).hours.from_.now._print(print_stdout=True)
2 hours from now
>>> t(1).week.ago._print(print_stdout=True)
1 week ago
```

## Changelog:
 + 1/28/2018 - Python 3 compatibility
 + 7/28/2014 - `t()` returns a `datetime.datetime.now()` object
